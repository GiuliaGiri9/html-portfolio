<h1>The Best Movie according to Giulia</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movie of all-time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Gladiator</h3>
 <p>I really liked the story, how he claimed the betrayal.<br />One of his most famous quote:
    <br />My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius,<br />
    commander of the Armies of the North,<br />General of the Felix Legions<br />
    and loyal servant to the True emperor, Marcus Aurelius.<br />
    Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife.<br />
    And i will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.</p><hr />
    <h3>American History X</h3>
    <p>I liked this film because it has a little bit of everything in the way it touches you. 
     This of course making it a very though provoking film. 
     Is a film that is ahead of its time (1998), as it tackles issues such as racism, 
     violence and the Neo-Nazi movement that is sadly prevalent today, 
     given the current situation of the world </p>

     <h3>Legend</h3>
     <p>Tom Hardy in this film was very incredible, how he manage to be two person with very different personality.
        A gangster movie set in the '60. It is a semi-true story.
